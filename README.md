# GolfBall_Video_Tracking
Technologies: Python, Annotation, Yolov5s Model

Retraining popular Yolo model to detect golf balls in videos

Screen recorded golf videos on youtube, split the videos into single frames (CV2 Python Library), and hand labeled golf balls via online Annotation website. Final result was a object detection model that only detected golf balls, and detected them more often and more accurately than the general Yolo object detection model.
